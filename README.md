After the first assignment in the course, they immediately hand you a set of problems that require some critical thinking and problem-solving skills. While it incorporated some simple "if" statement logic at the beginning, this assignment wasn't so much about math but sought to highlight a different way of thinking you needed to discover. Designing the logic from the outside -> in, handling all the edge cases first and then handling every other generic case. This also introduced some simple simulation that isn't used too frequently for the rest of the course.
This assignment also exposed some clear weaknesses/flaws of R, in that it isn't very efficient when using for loops, or if statements. If you use too many, or try to use it on too large of a dataset, the program will bog down. As a result, you are forced to vectorize your data, or use some form of apply() or lapply() to keep the program running efficiently.
